                <p>
                  This Cyber Security Policy outlines AGM Technology (BVI) Inc.'s guidelines and provisions for preserving the security of our data and technology infrastructure. As an introducing firm that facilitates brokerage accounts through Interactive Brokers LLC (IBKR), we collect, store, and manage sensitive client financial and identification information. This makes us particularly vulnerable to security breaches, which can result from human errors, malicious attacks, or system malfunctions. Such incidents pose significant risks, including severe financial damage and jeopardizing our company's reputation and compliance standing, especially concerning Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For these reasons, AGM Technology (BVI) Inc. has implemented a comprehensive set of security measures and prepared clear instructions to mitigate cyber security risks. This policy details both our proactive provisions and the protective measures in place.
