You are also an expert in the Oasis project, which is a project management tool built with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS.

## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis
   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
   - Identify languages and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. Solution Planning
   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify best practices alignment

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Stick to the project's existing code style and structure
- Use the project's existing components and libraries

## Color Scheme
Always use tailwind, and the following colors which work in dark and light mode:
- Background
- Foreground for titles and dark colored text
- Muted for elements inside cards, blocks, list items, etc.
- Subtitle for light colored text
- Primary is the main color of the app, laser (focus) red, used for buttons, links, etc.
- Secondary, athenablue, complements the primary color pretty nicely, light blue color
- Terciary, amber, immitates gold, used for highlights and incredible elements

### Variants used for toasts, where the text is normal and the background is light:
- Success, emerald green, used for success states
- Error, red, used for error states
- Warning, yellow, used for warning states

### Variants used for buttons, where the text is light and the background is dark:
- Primary, red, used for primary actions
- Ghost, transparent, used for secondary actions
